If you're looking for groceries, then Super Brugen is a great stop. Flying Tiger and Normal will have some snacks you can buy, otherwise there is 7 Eleven and Netto for quick stops.

### Transport

### Cycling

Copenhagen is the bike city of the world. You can get around almost anywhere with a bike. There are plenty around the streets to rent (including electric and non-electric bikes). Some hotels also do bike rental.

#### Ubers and taxis

Uber is non-existent in Denmark, so you'll need to order a taxi.

#### Trains

Copenhagen Central Station is the perfect way to get around. You can even jump on a short 45 minute train ride to Sweden!

#### Walking

Great city for walking. Everything is very walker friendly. Make sure you take good shoes, and remember cars will give way to you, but not bikes!

# Tips and tricks for travelling in Japan

### Eat everything!

Definitely try any and all food you can. Even the chains like coco ichibanya. There's so much good food everywhere in Japan. Most places asked dietary restrictions/allergies. However if you have dietaries, get them transalted into Japanese.

### Tours

[Qantas Tours](https://tours.qantas.com/) always have a tonne of deals. We ended up doing the Ultimate Japan tour, which is 20 days and took us all over Japan:

### Hotel

Make sure your hotels are near a metro station especially in Kyoto (one contributor walked about 240 miles during my stay according to my tracker).

### Mt Fushimi Inari summit

Check out Mt Fushimi in Kyoto if you have time. Itâ€™s quite the hike but beautiful.

### Osaka

If you have the chance in Osaka, go to see this person, pictures don't do it justice!

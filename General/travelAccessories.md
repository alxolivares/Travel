# Best items you need when you travel

## July

The best luggage going around is [July](https://july.com/au/). They have suitcases, roller cases, luggage covers, passport wallets, and more. Super high quality, great colours, good warranty, and great designs.

## Cadence

If you are travelling a lot, then [Cadenance leak proof containers](https://keepyourcadence.com/) are a must add to your travel luggage. They are light, don't leak, come in lots of colours, and can store all your pills, creams, liquids, and even small jewellery.
